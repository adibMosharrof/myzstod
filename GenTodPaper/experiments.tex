\section{Experimental Setup}

% SGD Dataset
% Schemas : from schema in sgd
% SGD-X Dataset

\subsection{Datasets}

We use the SGD \citep{rastogi2020towards} and SGD-X \citep{lee2022sgd} datasets to conduct experiments.
Seen domains are obtained from the train schema file and unseen domains from the eval and test schema files.
The models are trained on seen domains and inference is performed on all, seen and unseen domains.

To evaluate the performance of the models, we use metrics from SGD, MultiWoz 2.0 benchmark \citep{ramadan2018large} and introduce 2 novel metrics: Average Action Accuracy, Joint Action Accuracy.
These new metrics are similar to the goal metrics in SGD, but are performed on the actions.
For response generation, we report the ROUGE-2 \citep{lin2004looking} score and GLEU \citep{wu2016googles} instead of BLEU as it performs better on individual sentence pairs.
The combined score is calculated as suggested in \citep{mehri2019structured} with (Inform + Success) $\times$ 0.5 + GLEU.
