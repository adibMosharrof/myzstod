\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we have presented a novel Schema Guided Zero-Shot Generalizable End-to-End Task Oriented Dialog System using Context Summarization,
which to the best of our knowledge is the first End-to-End TOD system for the SGD dataset. We proposed to restructure the input to a TOD system,
by passing the last user utterance and the previous state DST as context instead of the dialog history. We also introduced a two step
training approach, where the model first learns the general structure of the data and then optimizes the generation.
To better understand our contributions, we have provided an ablation study that shows the importance of each component of our approach.
Our experimental results show that~\oursys~beats existing End-To-End TOD systems and outperforms state-of-the-art DST systems on key metrics
like Average and Joint Goal Accuracy by a large margin in the SGD dataset.
