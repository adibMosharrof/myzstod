Task Oriented Dialog (TOD) Systems that generalize well to unseen domain has been a challenging research area in dialog.
Existing methods mainly target individual components of TOD systems, but there are no End-to-End TOD systems that generalize well to unseen domains.
We introduce a novel TOD system that uses domain schema to generalize to unseen domains and propose to replace the dialog history with a
dialog summary as the context to the model. To enhance language generation, we suggest a two step training process where the goal of the first
pass is to learn the general structure of the data and the second pass is to optimize the generation.
Through experimental results on the SGD and SGD-X dataset, we demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state of the art models.
